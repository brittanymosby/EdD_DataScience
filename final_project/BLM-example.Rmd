## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see the guide on our class [Github page](https://brittanymosby.github.io/edd_datascience/assets/rmarkdown-reference.pdf). Your introduction section should explain the research project, the data, and how you will use the data to answer your research question. Note that only the **Title** should be level 1. Other document text (intro, analysis, recommendations) should be plain text, and not a header level.

When you **knit**, a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Each code chunk should have comments that briefly explain the commands/expected output-- however DO NOT provide analysis as a comment.

#Summary statistics for dataset
summary(cars)
```

## Graphical Analysis

Text outside of code chunks should be narrative analyzing the output. This should be plain text (i.e. no #header text). Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter is added to the code chunk below to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot, so only the graph shows. You can also give code chunks names (like the one below is `pressure` to organize your code.)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#This comment will not show in the knitted document, since I added `echo=FALSE` to the code chunk.
plot(pressure)
```

### Subsection
For subsections, increase the header level by adding another pound sign.
