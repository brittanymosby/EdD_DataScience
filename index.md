# Welcome to Data Science Sp21

This is the supplementary page for Professor Mosby's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. **Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for Async lectures and homework assignments.** Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if you’re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments have changed._)

## Async Lecture RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the Async lecture videos each week.
1. Module 1 - [Introduction](./scripts/01-intro.Rmd), [College datafile](./scripts/college.Rdata)
2. Module 2 - [Conditional Means](./scripts/02_conditional_means.Rmd), [Student Debt datafile](./scripts/sc_debt.Rdata)
  - **New video instructions:** First, watch 2.1 in the LMS; then, watch “conditional means part 1” (posted to course wall) and then “conditional means part 2” (posted to course wall). These videos will direct you when to watch LMS sections 2.7 and 2.8.
3. Module 3 - [Plotting Conditional Means](./scripts/03-plot_means.Rmd), [Attrition datafile](./scripts/attrition.Rdata)
4. Module 4 - [Getting Data: Flat Files and Tidy Data](./scripts/04-flat_data.Rmd)
  - Fixes for async and broken links in HW: [Week 4 Supplement](./scripts/04-supplement.Rmd)
5. Module 5 - [Using Regression for Prediction](./scripts/05-regression.Rmd), [ELS training data](./scripts/els_train.Rdata), [ELS testing data](./scripts/els_test.Rdata)
6. Module 6 - [Plotting Linear Regression with Scatterplots](./scripts/06-scatterplots.Rmd), [ELS full data](./scripts/els.Rdata)
7. Module 7 - [Getting Data: Web Sources](./scripts/07-webscraping-NEW.Rmd) (**This is the newest version, that matches Live Session from this week**)
8. Module 8 - [Classification](./scripts/08-classification.Rmd), [Za training file](./scripts/za_train.RData), [Za testing file](./scripts/za_test.RData)
  - ([Here](https://degreesofbelief.roryquinn.com/common-evaluation-measures-for-classification-models) is another good link for understanding the confusion matrix.)
9. Module 9 - [Plotting for Classification](./scripts/09-plots_classification-NEW.Rmd), [Za data file](./scripts/za.RData)
10. Module 10 - [Crossfold Validation](./scripts/10-cross_validation-NEW.Rmd)

### Live Session PPT Files
- [Week 2](./powerpt/Week 2 Overview and Review.pptx)
- [Week 3](./powerpt/Week 3 Overview and Review.pptx)
- [Week 5](./powerpt/Week 5 Overview and Review.pptx)

### Known Bugs/Issues in Async Lecture
- Week 1 - The answer for async exercise 1.7 (UNC admission rate) should be .34 or 34%.
- Week 4 - Please see above for supplementary material to fix issues with the Excel file download in async
- Week 5 - Async exercise 5.2 is referring to a dataset from a previous version of this lecture. Please skip this question for now.
- Weeks 8-9 - The async exercises appear to be referencing the Attrition data set from a previous lecture. Please skip these for now.

## Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets are due on the Sunday prior to the following week’s live session. All assignment submissions must include both the .Rmd file and a knitted file (html, doc, or pdf). There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting this requirement.

| File      | Due Date          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| [Assignment 1](./assignments/01-assignment.Rmd) | Sunday 1/17 |
| [Assignment 2](./assignments/02-assignment.Rmd) | Tuesday 1/26 |
| [Assignment 3](./assignments/03-assignment.md) | Tuesday 2/2 |
| [Assignment 4](./assignments/04-assignment.md) | Tuesday 2/9 |
| [Assignment 5](./assignments/05-assignment.md) | Tuesday 2/16 |
| [Assignment 6](./assignments/06-assignment.md) | Tuesday 2/23 |
| [Assignment 7](./assignments/07-assignment.md) | Saturday 3/13 |
| [Assignment 8](./assignments/08-assignment.md) | Saturday 3/20 |
| [Assignment 9](./assignments/09-assignment.md) | Saturday 3/27 |
| [Assignment 10](./assignments/10-assignment.md) | Saturday 3/27 |

## Final Project
The final project for this course will entail utilizing techniques learned over the semester to answer a research question with data of your choosing. You may work in groups of up to three people, or individually. Progress reports and their due dates are listed below.

| Progress Report      | Due Date      |
|:------------|:--------------|
|[PR #1](./final_project/01-progress_report.md) | Monday 2/22 |
|[PR #2](./final_project/02-progress_report.md) | Week of 3/22 |
