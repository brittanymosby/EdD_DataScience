# Welcome to Data Science, Spring 2021

This is the supplementary page for Professor Mosby's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. **Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for Async lectures and homework assignments.** Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if you’re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments have changed._)

## Async Lecture RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the Async lecture videos each week.
1. Week 1 - [Introduction](./scripts/01-intro.Rmd), [College datafile](./scripts/college.Rdata)
2. Week 2 - [Conditional Means](./scripts/02_conditional_means.Rmd), [Student Debt datafile](./scripts/sc_debt.Rdata)
  - **New video instructions:** First, watch 2.1 in the LMS; then, watch “conditional means part 1” (posted to course wall) and then “conditional means part 2” (posted to course wall). These videos will direct you when to watch LMS sections 2.7 and 2.8.
3. Week 3 - [Plotting Conditional Means](./scripts/03-plot_means.Rmd), [Attrition datafile](./scripts/attrition.Rdata)
4. Week 4 - [Getting Data: Flat Files and Tidy Data)(./scripts/04-flat_data.Rmd)

### Known Bugs/Issues in Async Lecture
- Week 1 - The answer for async exercise 1.7 (UNC admission rate) should be .34 or 34%.

## Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets are due on the Sunday prior to the following week’s live session. All assignment submissions must include both the .Rmd file and a knitted file (html, doc, or pdf). There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting this requirement.
