## Welcome to Data Science

In this GitHub Repository you will find all the files you need for this term of Data Science (LLO8200). We'll talk more about this in class, but this will get you started. Over the course of the term, I may update assignments/code/etc... so please alert me if you're going to be working ahead. If you work ahead and then things change, you will be responsible for updating your work.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](./slides/01_01_welcome.pptx) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

you can [get the PDF]({{https://github.com/brittanymosby/edd_datascience}}/slides/01_01_welcome.pptx) directly.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
