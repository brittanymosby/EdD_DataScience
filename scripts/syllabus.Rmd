Introduction
=============

We have entered a time in which vast amounts of data are more widely
available than ever before. At the same time, a new set of tools has
been developed to analyze this data and provide decision makers with
information to help them accomplish their goals. Those who engage with
data and interpret it for organizational leaders have taken to calling
themselves data scientists, and their craft data science. Other terms
that have come into vogue are "Big Data," "Predictive Analytics" and
"Data Mining." These can seem to be mysterious domains. The point of
this class is to demystify much of this endeavor for individuals who
will be organizational leaders.

The class is structured around developing students' skills in three
areas: getting data, analyzing data to make predictions, and
presenting the results of analysis. For each area, the subtopics are
as follows:

Getting Data Topics
--------------------
* Tools of the Trade: R and Rstudio
* Working with pre-processed data and flat files
* Getting data from the web: webscraping, using forms, using Application Programming Interfaces
* Using databases

Analyzing Data Topics
----------------------
* Descriptives and conditional means
* Regression
* Supervised learning: classification
* Unsupervised learning: K-means and nearest neighbors clustering
* Cross Validation

Presenting Data Analysis Topics
---------------------------------
* Descriptives: histograms, density plots, bar plots, dot
  plots
* Scatterplots
* Lattice graphics and small multiples
* Interactive graphics
* Communicating results effectively

Evaluation
===========
Students will be evaluated based in two areas: weekly Problem sets and
the final project. 

* Problem sets: 65% Each week I will assign a problem set for
  students to complete. These problem sets will be assigned on Monday,
  and will be due the next Sunday night at 11:59:59 pm. No late
  problem sets will be accepted. Each problem set will be graded on a
  100 point scale. Your lowest grade will be dropped. 
  
  There will be 13 assigned problem sets, with each problem set worth 100 points. The lowest grade will be dropped, meaning that you will be graded on 12 of these problem sets. The grading standards will be as follows:
  
  50=turned in problem set, did not attempt most of the problems
  
  75= turned in problem set, attempted most of the problems
  
  100= turned in problem set, attempted all of the problems
  
  Note that your grade on problem sets does not depend on you being correct on all problems, but simply making a serious attempt to answer all of the problems. 

* Final Project 35%: During the course of the semester you will
  work on a final assignment utilizing your skills as a data
  analyst.  
  
There will be four progress reports for the final project, each of which will be worth 12.5% of the final  grade for the project. No late progress reports will be accepted. The final product will account for the remaining 50%. No late final products will be accepted. 
  
There are two parts to the final project grade, your progress reports and the product itself. Each project report is worth 12.5% of the grade. These will be graded based on completion of the enumerated steps in the report, and will be graded on a 100 point scale.
  
The final product will be worth 50% of your final project grade. A rubric will be supplied containing the relevant grading information for this final product. 
  

Texts
======

*Required Texts*

We will have two texts for the course. The first is Hadley Wickham's book, 
[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 

Wickham, H., & Grolemund, G. (2016). R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. San Francisco: O'Reilly Media, Inc.

The other text is Nate Silver's *Signal and the Noise*. 

Silver,N. (2012). *The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail-but some donâ€™t*. New York: Penguin. 

Software
==========
We will use only free, [open source](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) software in this course. 

We will use  [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), an open-source data analytic
platform for all analysis. R appears to be the most widely used data analysis software in data science. We will utilize [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/home/) as our integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 

Honor Code Statement
===============

All assignments for this class, including weekly problem sets and the final project, are to be conducted under the obligations set out in Vanderbilt's Honor Code. Please click [here](http://www.vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook/the-honor-system/)to review the honor code.

There will be two quite different standards for completing the
problem sets and the final project. 

*problem sets* You may collaborate with anyone and you may utilize
  any resource you wish to complete these problem sets. 
  
*Final Project* All of the work on the final assignment must be
  your own. Anyone's work that you reference should be cited, as
  usual. All data that you do not personally collect must be cited, as with any other resource. 

If you have any questions at all about the honor code or how it will
be applied, ask me right away.
