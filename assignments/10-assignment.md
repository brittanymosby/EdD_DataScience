Assignment 10
---

Based on your work in assignment 5, do the following:

1. Create a 10-fold cross validation of your linear model predicting reading scores as a function of at least two co-variates. Provide a summary table or graphic of the RMSEs from this cross validation.

2. Using a different set of co-variates, create a second linear model predicting reading scores. Create a 10-fold cross validation of this model, and graph the RMSEs.

3. Which model performed better? How do you know?

4. Using a random partition, create 100 separate cross validations of your first linear model predicting reading scores as a function of at least two co-variates. Provide a summary table or graphic of the RMSEs from this cross validation.
