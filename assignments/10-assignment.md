Based on your work in assignment 5, do the following:

1. Create a 10-fold cross validation of your linear model predicting reading scores as a function of at least two covariates. Provide a summary table or graphic of the RMSEs from this cross validation.
2. Using a random partition, create 100 separate cross validations of your linear model predicting reading scores as a function of at least two covariates. Provide a summary table or graphic of the RMSEs from this cross validation.
