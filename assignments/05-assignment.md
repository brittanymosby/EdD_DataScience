----------------

In this assignment, you'll be asked to predict reading scores using the ELS data.

1. Create a regression that predicts **reading scores** as a function of **SES**, using the training data.
2. Report the root mean squared error (rmse) from a validation of your model using the testing data. 
3. Add another co-variate (predictor) to your model from 1. 
4. Again report the rmse from a validation of your model using the testing data. Did you model improve? By how much?
