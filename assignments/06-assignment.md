Complete the following steps using the `.Rdata` or file. I want you to use the `ggplot` library and commands for all plots. Use the `els` data to complete the following steps.

1. Choose a dependent variable and plot that dependent variable as a function of a continuous independent variable.
2. If you need to, adjust the scale of either the dependent variable or independent variable to make more sense. 
3. Add a line of best fit to your graphic. 
4. Clean up the labeling and description of the graphic so that it could be presented to a broader audience. 
7. In your .Rmd file, include a few sentences describing what the graphic above shows.
